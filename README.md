#About project;-
Upper Moons represents krisaan.
our problem statement is to overcome global warming in the field of irrigation.so lets see how our project is going to work.
we will mix baking soda and vineger to make co2 in a tight container connecting our polyhouse.it will send the co2 in the polyhouse .co2 sensor will sense the volume of co2 in the polyhouse.
during the night no photosynthesis takes place so we installed RB lights to give sufficient amount of energy to plants for photosynthesis during night.
we are also using soil sensor which eill tell us the value of moisture in the soil.if the moisture level is less than the given value then the sprinklers will start to watering the field and will stop after it exceed the given value.
we are using 4 sensors in our project and these are soil moisture sensor,humidity sensor,temperature sensor,carbon dioxide sensor.
Everything is monitired in the krisaan app ,through this you can check the real time update.
